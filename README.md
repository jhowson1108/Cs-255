The client for the DriverPass project is Liam, the 
owner of DriverPass, a company dedicated to helping users prepare for 
their driving tests. The system was designed to support online class 
registrations, practice exams, scheduling driving lessons, and keeping 
DMV rules and policies up to date.
Reflection
What I Did Well:
I
 effectively captured and organized the client’s requirements, ensuring 
the system design aligned with DriverPass’s vision and business needs.
What I’d Revise:
If
 I could improve one area, it would be the flexibility of the design to 
support future updates, such as adding or removing lesson packages more 
easily. As well as fleshing out the diagrams and concepts better, less rushed work.
Interpreting User Needs:
I 
incorporated features like secure account access, role-based 
permissions, and intuitive online scheduling. Considering user needs is 
vital to ensure the system is accessible, functional, and enhances the 
user experience.
Approach to Design:
I
 broke the project into clear stages, used UML diagrams for clarity, and
 focused on collaboration. In the future, I would leverage iterative 
feedback loops and automated tools to refine designs more efficiently.
